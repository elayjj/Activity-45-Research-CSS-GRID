CSS Grid Layout is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows developers to create complex and responsive web layouts with ease. It provides a two-dimensional grid-based approach, enabling the arrangement of elements into rows and columns. This method offers greater flexibility and control compared to traditional layout techniques like floats or positioning.

Key Features of CSS Grid:
Two-Dimensional Layout: CSS Grid allows for the simultaneous control of both rows and columns, making it easier to design complex layouts.
Explicit vs. Implicit Grids: Developers can define explicit grid structures using properties like grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, or rely on implicit grids that adapt to content without specific definitions45.
Responsive Design: CSS Grid supports responsive design through flexible units like fr (fractional units), which adjust according to available space24.
